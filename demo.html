# Demo Markdown Slides

- This is the first slide!
- This is just bare markdown (with a .html file extension).  Check out the page source!
- This is powered by [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

You can use all the normal features of Markdown.  Below is some code:

``` python
print('hello')

class Baz:
    def biz(self, x):
    print(x)
```

Just include this line at the bottom of your Markdown!

``` html
<script src="https://evidlo.github.io/remark_auto/main.js"/></script>
```
